<ul>
<li><p>Lab 2</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-FrankiePaniagua004/tree/main/part-1"><strong>Lab 2</strong></a> is one of my favorite labs because we used math to convert temperature.
  This lab showed me how to use math in programming, which was very interesting. I experimented a lot with this lab, especially with the integer character inputs.</p>

<li><p>Lab 3</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-FrankiePaniagua004"><strong>Lab 3</strong></a> Was another one of my favorites because we had diffrent variables for each food type and when we executed the program it would put these variables next to a string sentence. I also liked the number guessing program we did because I learned how we can use the while loop and a boolean to check if the answer was true, if it was then the boolean would turn to false and would stop the program. I also liked how we also used math to know if we were close to the asnwer.</p>

<li><p>Lab 4</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-04-FrankiePaniagua004"><strong>Lab 4</strong></a> is also one of my favorites because i liked how we used math to find out how many days a period of time was. I also liked how we had to create a program to convert length.</p>

<p>In the future I see myself collabing with one of my cousins to develope a social media app. I also want to start a company with my cousin. But as a starting point i will try to get a job as a software engineer for the good pay. </p>
