# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Frankie Paniagua and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Enginnering

## Computer Science Projects

My GitHub page is http://github.com/FrankiePaniagua004.

## Three of my favorite labs would have to be lab 2, 3, 4

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2
    > [**Lab 2**](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-FrankiePaniagua004/tree/main/part-1) is one of my favorite labs because we used math to convert temperature.
    This lab showed me how to use math in programming, which was very interesting. I experimented a lot with this lab, especially with the integer character inputs.

* Lab 3
    > [**Lab 3**](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-FrankiePaniagua004) Was another one of my favorites because we had diffrent variables for each food type and when we executed the program it would put these variables next to a string sentence. I also liked the number guessing program we did because I learned how we can use the while loop and a boolean to check if the answer was true, if it was then the boolean would turn to false and would stop the program. I also liked how we also used math to know if we were close to the asnwer.

* Lab 4
    > [**Lab 4**](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-04-FrankiePaniagua004) is also one of my favorites because i liked how we used math to find out how many days a period of time was. I also liked how we had to create a program to convert length.

## Future: 
> In the future I see myself collabing with one of my cousins to develope a social media app. I also want to start a company with my cousin. But as a starting point i will try to get a job as a software engineer for the good pay. 

## Collab Projects:

This is one of the projects i collabed wit my bro, i also got alot of other projects ive made with unity, me and my cousin like to work on projects together and alone with each others code to see what its kinda like to work with other peoples code
